# GG2-Map-Archive
http://www.ganggarrison.com

An attempt at a public library of every Gang Garrison 2 map, including avaliable past versions, correct sorting, and correct naming.
Use the search function at the top of the github page to find any map, or simply browse through the maps.

Anyone is free to contribute either by personally contacting me or directly through github. See https://help.github.com for instructions (add specific instructions here at some point on cloning/pull request).
Unfinished maps are welcome too, a compiled version is prefered.

## Requested Maps
* cp_gravelpits (Haxxy 2011)
* cp_space (Haxxy 2011)
* koth_pillarpedestal (Haxxy 2015)
* gametype_Reign (Haxxy 2015, by Spazz)
* Old versions of ctf_conflict
* Old versions of any other official maps
* Big ctf_conflict, upscaled version of the map based on a quite old version, every normal pixel requires a jump
* Gang Garrison Classic Mod maps
* INS Mod maps
