# GG2-Map-Archive
http://www.ganggarrison.com

A public library of every Gang Garrison 2 map, including available past versions, correctly sorted by gamemode, with correct and standardized naming.  
Anyone is free to contribute either by posting in the thread, personally contacting me, or directly contributing through github **(this is preferred)**. See https://help.github.com for help.
Unfinished maps are welcome, however a compiled and playable version is prefered. If a map is broken please let me know, and if you can, provide a working version of the map.

## Guidelines for Contributing
Please try to follow these guidelines before contributing:
* Maps are correctly named following the standard format using the correct gamemode prefixes and version numbering notation.
* Maps are sorted into the correct gamemode folders.
* Maps are not duplicates of maps already in the archive.
